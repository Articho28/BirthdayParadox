# BirthdayParadox
Program that simulates the birthday problem. 

The birthday paradox states that if there are 23 people in a room, there is a 50% chance that two people in the room share the same birthday. When there is 70 people in a room, this probability reaches 99.9% (Wikipedia.org). This program, disregarding leap years and assuming each birthay is equally likely, simulates the experiment.
